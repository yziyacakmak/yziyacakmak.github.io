I am a software engineer at Saykal Electronics, where I specialize in designing and developing software with a focus on user interfaces for automotive embedded systems. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Kocaeli University and also pursued a double major in Mechatronics Engineering, although I chose to discontinue the program to fully focus on my professional career after entering the workforce. I am deeply interested in automotive cybersecurity, secure software updating, and the technical depths of C# programming, including topics like garbage collection and source generators. Beyond my professional life, I am an enthusiast of Turkish classical music and enjoy playing the [ney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ney) as a hobby.
